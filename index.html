            Icthus is a Bible app for iPhone and iPad. Its goal is to present the text of the Bible in a clean, modern interface. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of our Bibles are designed for reference. Icthus is designed for reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Icthus removes chapter headings and footnotes. 
            Chapter and verse numbers are hidden until you need them. 
            The font is large with plenty of space between lines. 
            No red text, no narrow columns, nothing to interrupt your time with the Word.
