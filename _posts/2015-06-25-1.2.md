Today Icthus 1.2 is available for download. In it you'll find some new features including:
* Support for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus screen sizes
* Support for landscape orientation
* Support for handoff
* Icthus is now open source!

Icthus is a labor of love. I'm the sole developer and don't make any money from the work I do for it. That said, the decision to make Icthus free is an easy one because having a Bible designed for reading is something that everyone should have access to. 

For the same reasons, making Icthus open source was also an easy decision. This allows other developers to read the code, offer improvements, use Icthus as a starting point for their own app, or even redistribute copies of Icthus itself. If you're intereseted, you can find the source code for Icthus on [Github](https://github.com/icthus/icthus-ios).
