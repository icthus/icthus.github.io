Today Icthus 1.1 is available on the App Store. 

This version contains a few tweaks and new features, including:

* The King James Version of the Bible is now available free of charge. You can use it by navigating to the Translations list from the Settings screen.
* A Dark Mode has been added which is ideal for reading in low-light conditions. It looks so good, you may just prefer to stay in Dark Mode all day long :)
* Icthus now supports Background App Refresh. If you use Icthus on multiple devices and are signed into iCloud, then Icthus will sync your reading history even when the app is closed.

You can expect another update sometime this fall, which will include more translations and some cool new features. If you enjoy using Icthus, please [rate it](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewContentsUserReviews?pageNumber=0&sortOrdering=1&type=Purple+Software&mt=8&id=869573440) on the App Store.
